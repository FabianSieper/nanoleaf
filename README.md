# Nanoleaf Taskfile Toolkit

This repository provides a collection of Taskfile tasks to help you discover, authenticate, and control your Nanoleaf Light Panels directly from the command line. With a few simple commands, you can:

- Scan your local network to find your Nanoleaf deviceâ€™s IP.
- Generate and store an API token for future requests.
- Toggle your panels on or off.
- Adjust brightness interactively.

All saved credentials are managed in a `nanoleaf.json` file at the root of this repo.

## Requirements

- **Taskfile** (v3) â€“ [taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev/)
- **nmap** â€“ for network scanning.
- **jq** â€“ for JSON parsing.
- **gum** â€“ for interactive prompts in the terminal.
- **curl** â€“ for HTTP requests.
- **Homebrew** (macOS) or your platformâ€™s package manager to install dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nanoleaf-taskfile.git
   cd nanoleaf-taskfile
   ```

2. Install the required tools via Homebrew:

```bash
task install
```

   > **Note:** On Linux, replace the `brew install` calls in the `install` task with your distroâ€™s package manager.

## Usage

1. **Find your Nanoleaf IP**

   ```bash
   task get-nanoleaf-ip
   ```

   Prints the first Light-Panels device IP on your network.

2. **Pair and store your API token**

   ```bash
   task get-nanoleaf-token
   ```

   Retrieves a new pairing token and appends its `{ip, token}` to `nanoleaf.json` (avoids duplicates).

3. **Toggle panels on/off**

   ```bash
   task nanoleaf-control
   ```

   Opens an interactive menu to select a device and action (`on` or `off`).

4. **Adjust brightness**

```bash
task nanoleaf-brightness
```

   Select a device and enter a brightness value (0â€“100).

## nanoleaf.json

After pairing, `nanoleaf.json` will contain an array of objects:

```json
[
  { "ip": "192.168.178.95", "token": "YourAuthToken" },
  ...
]
```

You can edit or remove entries manually if needed.
